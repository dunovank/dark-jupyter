### Help support me
I firmly believe that software is best served open and, as such, am committed to providing free and easy access to all my code. So if you can't make a financial contribution, then don't and use it anyway! But if you're sitting on some extra time and enjoy using a package I've developed, then any amount of help is *greatly* appreciated.
