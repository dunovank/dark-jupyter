# dark-jupyter
### Dark theme for Jupyter Notebook! ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-orange.svg) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)

### Requirements
* Python 2.7+, 3.0+
* Jupyter ([Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) recommended)
* Matplotlib

### Help support me
I firmly believe that software is best served open and, as such, am committed to providing free and easy access to all my code. So if you can't make a financial contribution, then don't and use it anyway! But if you're sitting on some extra time and enjoy using a package I've developed, then any amount of help is *greatly* appreciated.
