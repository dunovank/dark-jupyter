**Dark-Jupyter** theme is specially designed for Jupyter Notebook. It works on any version of the notebook. It supports all different versions of python and works in synch with any other jupyter extensions.
Due to extensive changes in Jupyter Lab with respect to the notebook implementation, this theme doesn't support Jupyter Lab.

### How to install ?

If familier with **git** and a *nerd*,

```
$ git clone https://github.com/colorpal/dark-jupyter.git
$ mv dark-jupyter ~/.jupyter/custom/
```

### Most important question of all: How to uninstall ?
Simply remove the downloaded folder.
```
$ rm -rf .jupyter/custom/dark-jupyter
```

### Requirements
* Python 2.7+, 3.0+
* Jupyter ([Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) recommended)
* Matplotlib


### How to support me?
I firmly believe that software is best served open and, as such, am committed to providing free and easy access to all my code. If you're sitting on some extra time and enjoy using a package I've developed, then any amount of help is *greatly* appreciated. **We are open to any kind of suggestions regarding style and structure of the theme*.*

Please click on the *Star* button of this repository (present at the top-right corner) to show some extra appreciation.
