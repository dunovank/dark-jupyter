Contributing to dark-jupyter
============================

How to contribute
-----------------

The preferred workflow for contributing to sherlock-theme is to fork the
[main repository](https://github.com/colorpal/dark-jupyter/) on
GitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/colorpal/dark-jupyter/)
   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates
   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on
   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

2. Clone your fork of the sherlock-them repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/dark-jupyter.git
   $ cd dark-jupyter
   ```

3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b yourname-feature
   ```
   This will also change the branch from master to the newly created branch. If not change branch using command:
   
   ```bash
   $ git checkout yourname-feature
   ```
   
   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!

4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:

   ```bash
   $ git add modified_files
   $ git commit
   ```

   to record your changes in Git, then push the changes to your GitHub account with:

   ```bash
   $ git push -u origin yourname-feature
   ```

5. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
to create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.

(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the
[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)


Pull Request Checklist
----------------------

We recommended that your contribution complies with the
following rules before you submit a pull request:

-  Give your pull request a helpful title that summarises what your
   contribution does. In some cases `Fix <ISSUE TITLE>` is enough.
   `Fix #<ISSUE NUMBER>` is not enough.

-  Often pull requests resolve one or more other issues (or pull requests).
   If merging your pull request means that some other issues/PRs should
   be closed, you should
   [use keywords to create link to them](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests/)
   (e.g., `Fixes #1234`; multiple issues/PRs are allowed as long as each one
   is preceded by a keyword). Upon merging, those issues/PRs will
   automatically be closed by GitHub. If your pull request is simply related
   to some other issues/PRs, create a link to them without using the keywords
   (e.g., `See also #1234`).

-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample
   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.

-  Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be
   accepted. Bug-fixes or new features should be provided with 
   [non-regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-regression_testing).
   These tests verify the correct behavior of the fix or feature. In this
   manner, further modifications on the code base are granted to be consistent
   with the desired behavior.
   For the Bug-fixes case, at the time of the PR, this tests should fail for
   the code base in master and pass for the PR code.

You can also check for common programming errors.

Filing bugs
-----------
We use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to
open an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

It is recommended to check that your issue complies with the
following rules before submitting:

-  Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other
   [issues](https://github.com/colorpal/dark-jupyter/issues?q=)
   or [pull requests](https://github.com/colorpal/dark-jupyter/pulls?q=).

-  Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in
   appropriate code blocks.
   See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).
